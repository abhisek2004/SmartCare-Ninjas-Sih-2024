## Problem Statement Title

**Optimizing Queuing Models and Resource Availability in Hospitals for Enhanced Patient Care 🏥**

### Description

In the current healthcare environment, managing patient flow and resource allocation is critical, especially in Outpatient Departments (OPDs) and during patient admissions. Hospitals often face challenges in efficiently queuing patients, managing bed availability, and processing admissions, leading to increased waiting times, patient dissatisfaction, and potential risks to patient health.

This problem statement focuses on developing a hospital-based solution that can optimize queuing models in OPDs, manage bed availability, and streamline the admission process. The solution should be designed to integrate seamlessly with a city-wide healthcare module, allowing for real-time data sharing and coordination across multiple healthcare facilities.

#### Key Objectives

- **Queuing Optimization:** 🕒 Develop algorithms to reduce patient waiting times in OPDs by predicting patient flow and adjusting queuing models dynamically.
- **Bed Availability Management:** 🛏️ Create a system to monitor and forecast bed occupancy, ensuring efficient allocation of available beds and timely admissions.
- **Admission Process Streamlining:** 📑 Automate the admission process to reduce paperwork, minimize errors, and expedite patient onboarding.

The solution should leverage data analytics, machine learning, and real-time communication technologies to enhance the overall efficiency of hospital operations, improve patient experiences, and ensure better utilization of healthcare resources.

Integration with a city-wide module will enable hospitals to coordinate care, share critical resource information, and respond more effectively to surges in patient demand, particularly during emergencies or pandemics.
